/**
 * The microtimer class is used to instantiate a high-resolution microsecond
 * timer. This is a relative timer--i.e. it cannot be used to tell you the time
 * of day, month, or year, only the number of microseconds which have passed
 * between two events. A microsecond is one millionth of a second.
 *
 * Usage example:
 *
 *   microtimer            microtime;
 *   microtimer::size_type start, end;
 *
 *   start = microtime();
 *
 *       // Code to time here
 *
 *   end   = microtime();
 *
 *   std::cout << (end - start) << "Micros." << std::endl;
